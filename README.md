# take-those-notes🗒
Note Taker application that can be used to write and save notes.

## Description📓
A user can create notes, save them to the application database, and view them by clicking on the saved note icon on the left side of the screen. Click the + button and start typing to add a new note. After you've finished writing your note, click the save icon in the upper right corner to save it. The server.js file employs Express.js to GET, POST, and DELETE the JSON notes stored on the server.
